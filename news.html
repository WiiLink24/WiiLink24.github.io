                <ul>
                    <li>The site has gotten a bit of a makeover! Rather than have one page for everything, there are now individual pages for the services. This way, we can have screenshots and more detailed info about each service.</li>
                    <li>The Public Beta is OUT! Wii Room is now available to all in the form of a beta. This means that not everything is present as of now but we'll add more features in the future. To get it, check out the Guide!</li>
                    <li>Thanks to everyone who was part of the launch event on the 5th! We had an awesome time in our Discord!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thanks for reading, see you next time for another news report!</p>

                <h3>Welcome to the first news issue for WiiLink24! I'll be making news reports here every so often to tell you about what's going on at WL24. Here's what you need to know:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wii Room Public Beta - Starting this Saturday, we'll be opening up Wii Room as an open beta. This means that some things won't be fully finished but it'll be open for everyone to use. We'll be streaming on our YouTube channel on Saturday to commemorate this occasion, so be sure to join us then! Check it right here! We currently do not have anything to announce at this time regarding Dokodemo Wii no Ma/Wii Room Go, but we'll update the site with new info when we do.</li>
                    <li>Mascot - In case you haven't been following our Twitter,  we're here to say that we have a mascot - Digi! He'll be used throughout promotional material, and we have emojis of him in our Discord. He also has a Twitter of his own, which you can see right here. </li>
                    <li>Ask us stuff! If you're in our Discord, we have a new channel called #wl24-ama, where you can ask us questions about the service. Don't be afraid to ask anything!</li>
