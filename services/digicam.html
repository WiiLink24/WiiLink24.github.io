  Print Channel was a Wii Channel that was released only in Japan. It was created in
  collaboration with Fujifilm. In it, players are able to upload images onto the Wii
  via an SD Card in the same way they would with the Photo Channel. Next, they can pick
  their favorite photos and send them to Fujifilm, who'll process them (for a price) and
  send them to the player.</a></p></h3>
